This repository contains a MIPS assembly program that demonstrates a simple implementation of the Caesar cipher for string encryption and decryption. The program prompts the user to enter a string (up to 20 characters), encrypts it by shifting each characterâ€™s ASCII value by a fixed key (default = 3), and then decrypts it back to its original form.
