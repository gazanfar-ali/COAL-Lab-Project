# String-EncryptionDecryption 

A simple MIPS assembly program that demonstrates **string encryption and decryption** using the classic **Caesar cipher** technique. The program takes a user-input string (up to 20 characters), encrypts it by shifting each character‚Äôs ASCII value by a fixed key, and then decrypts it back to its original form.

## üìå Features  
- User input handling (up to 20 characters)  
- String encryption with a Caesar cipher (default shift = 3)  
- String decryption to restore original text  
- Uses MARS/SPIM syscalls for I/O and program termination  
- Educational example for learning **MIPS Assembly** and **basic cryptography**  

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives  
By working with this project, you will:  
- Understand how to handle **string input/output** in MIPS assembly.  
- Learn to use **system calls (syscall)** for I/O operations in MARS/SPIM.  
- Explore **memory allocation** for strings using `.space` and `.asciiz`.  
- Practice **looping and branching** with instructions like `beq`, `j`, and `addi`.  
- Implement a **Caesar cipher** by manipulating ASCII values in registers.  
- Gain insight into **low-level cryptography concepts** through assembly.

## üöÄ Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- [MARS MIPS Simulator](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/) or [SPIM](https://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/)  

### Running the Program  
1. Open `cipher.s` in **MARS** or **SPIM**.  
2. Assemble and run the program.  
3. Enter a string when prompted.  
4. The program will display the encrypted and decrypted versions of the string.

## üìù Example Output  
```bash
Enter a string (max 20 chars): hello
Encrypted string: khoor
Decrypted string: hello
```
